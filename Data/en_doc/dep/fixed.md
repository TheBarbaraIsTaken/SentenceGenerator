The `fixed` relation is one of the three relations for multiword expressions (MWEs)
(the other two being [flat]() and [compound]()). 
It is used for certain fixed grammaticized expressions that behave
like function words or short adverbials.

The fixed relation is used for certain fixed grammaticized expressions with function words that behave like a single function word. 
Fixed expressions are annotated in a flat, head-initial structure, in which all words in the expression modify the first one using the
`fixed` label.

At present, this relation is used inside the following expressions, semantically grouped for convenience: 

| Category | Expressions |
|----------|-------------|
| [Augmentative/substitutive/conjunctive](#augmentativesubstitutiveconjunctive-expressions) | *as well*, *as well as*, *rather than*, *instead of*, *let alone* |
| [Causal](#causal-connectives) | *because of*, *due to*, *how come*, *in order*, *so as to*, *so that* |
| [Spatiotemporal](#spatiotemporal-markers) | *in between*, *prior to* |
| [Circumstantial/conditional](#circumstantialconditional-connectives) | *in case (of)*, *whether or not* |
| [Approximators](#approximators-quantity-modifiers) | with a quantity: *more than*, *less than*, *up to*, *as many/much/few/little as* |
| [Attributional](#attributional-markers) | *according to* |
| [Exemplification](#exemplification) | *such as* |
| [Reciprocal Pronouns](#reciprocal-pronouns) | *each other*, *one another* |
| [Pragmatic/miscellaneous](#pragmaticmiscellaneous-markers) | *all but*, *as for*, *as if*, *as opposed to*, *as to*, *at least* (non-quantity), *in that*, *kind/sort of* (hedge), *not to mention*, *of course*, *that is* |

Below the description of `fixed` expressions are a few idiomatic combinations that are [analyzed without `fixed`](#not-fixed). These are summarized as follows:

| Non-`fixed` Expressions |
|-------------------------|
| Double spatial prepositions: *out of*, *off of*, etc. |
| *as soon/long as*; *at all*, *at best/worst*, *by far*; *at most/least* (with quantities); *compared to/with*; *had better*; *nothing/anything but*; *so long*; *what about*, *what if* |

## `fixed` expressions

### Augmentative/substitutive/conjunctive expressions

*as well*

~~~ sdparse
I like dogs as/ADV well/ADV
advmod(like, as)
fixed(as, well)
~~~

*as well as*

~~~ sdparse
I like dogs as/ADV well/ADV as/ADP cats
fixed(as-4, well)
fixed(as-4, as-6)
cc(cats, as-4)
conj(dogs, cats)
~~~

<!-- TODO: add POS tags for remaining examples -->

*rather than* <!-- https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English-EWT/issues/182 -->

Typically analyzed as a coordinating conjunction:

~~~ sdparse
I decided to get a dog rather than a cat
fixed(rather, than)
cc(cat, rather)
conj(dog, cat)
~~~

However, when fronted, it attaches as `case` or `mark`:

~~~ sdparse
Rather than a cat , I decided to get a dog.
fixed(Rather, than)
case(cat, Rather)
obl(decided, cat)
~~~

*instead of* <!-- https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English-EWT/issues/182 -->

Similar in meaning to *rather than*, but never analyzed as a coordinating conjunction, always `case` or `mark`:

~~~ sdparse
John went instead of Mary
fixed(instead, of)
case(Mary, instead)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
John left early instead of staying for the whole thing
fixed(instead, of)
mark(staying, instead)
