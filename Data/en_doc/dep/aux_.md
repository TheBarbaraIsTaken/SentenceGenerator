An `aux` (auxiliary) of a clause is a function word associated with a verbal predicate that
expresses categories such as tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality. It is often a verb
(which may have non-auxiliary uses as well).

In English, an auxiliary of a clause is a non-main verb of the clause, e.g., a
modal auxiliary, or a form of *be*, *do* or *have* in a periphrastic
tense. This includes the passive auxiliary, which we give the subtype `aux:pass`.
We allow the *get*-passive (*The book got stolen*) as an
auxiliary, but not other [xcomp]()-taking verbs such as *become*.

(Contrary to the older SD and arguments of Pullum (1982) and following,
infinitive *to* is not analyzed as an auxiliary. Instead, it is analyzed
as a [mark]().)
