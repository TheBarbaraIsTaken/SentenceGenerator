### <a name="Prs">`Prs`</a>: personal or possessive personal pronoun or determiner

* _a, an, the_

### <a name="Int">`Int`</a>: interrogative pronoun, determiner or adverb

Note that the possessive interrogative determiner (_whose_) can be
distinguished by the [Poss]() feature.

In English, all words with the PTB tag `WDT`, `WP`, `WP$` or `WRB` have this feature unless
they mark the beginning of a [relative clause](en-dep/acl:relcl).

#### Examples

* _<b>Which</b> one should I get?_
