* _<b>Read</b> the book!_

Infinitive is the citation form of verbs in many languages.

#### Examples:

* _I have to <b>leave</b>_.

### <a name="Part">`Part`</a>: participle

Participle is a non-finite verb form that shares properties of verbs and adjectives. It is used to form various periphrastic verb forms such as complex tenses and passives. In English, all words with the PTB tag `VBD` have this feature. Further, words with the PTB tag `VBG` can also have this feature if they are preceded by an inflection of _to be_.

#### Examples:

* _He could have <b>been prepared</b> if he had forseen it_.
* _I will be <b>driving</b> home_.


### <a name="Ger">`Ger`</a>: gerund

Gerund is a non-finite verb form that shares properties of verbs and nouns. In English, all words with the PTB tag `VBG` have this feature if they are not preceded by an inflection of _to be_.

#### Examples:

* _I look forward to <b>seeing</b> you._
* _She turns a blind eye to my <b>being</b> late._
